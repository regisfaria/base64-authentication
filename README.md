# Base64 Authorization Example

## Overview

This repository was created aiming to provide an example on how to create an base64 buffer authentication using one **Api KEY and Api Secret** for another API I've developed.

## Installation & Running

First of all, you will find a file called: **"main.js"**. There you can find two variable where you can add your respective credentials.

After editing the script, Simply run the **"main.js"** file with:"
